The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPy’s syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and
	functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates
	them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6× to 7.5× faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the
	CPU and between 6.5× and 44× faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.}

@TechReport {export:115396,
abstract     = {<p>Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research
                community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing
                recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a
                recommendation system must choose between a set of candidate approaches.  A first
                step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of
                the application to focus upon when making this choice.  Indeed, recommendation
                systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as
                accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss how to
                compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for e
                application. We focus on comparative studies, where a few algorithms are compared
                using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms. We
                describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms.
                We review three types of experiments, starting with an offline setting, where
                recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing
                user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and
                report on the experience, and finally describe large scale online experiments,
                where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we
                describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for
                experimentation. We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from e
                conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how
                to evaluate systems given relevant properties. We also survey a large set of
                evaluation metrics in the context of the property that they evaluate.</p>},

@phdthesis {1242,
	title = {Music Recommendation and Discovery in the Long Tail},
	year = {2008},
	school = {Universitat Pompeu Fabra},
	address = {Barcelona},
	abstract = {<p class="small">
Music consumption is biased towards a few popular artists. For instance, in 2007 only 1\% of
all digital tracks accounted for 80\% of all sales. Similarly, 1,000 albums accounted for 50\%
of all album sales, and 80\% of all albums sold were purchased less than 100 times. There is
a need to assist people to filter, discover, personalise and recommend from the huge amount
of music content available along the Long Tail.
</p>
<p class="small">
Current music recommendation algorithms try to
accurately predict what people demand to listen to. However, quite
often these algorithms tend to recommend popular -or well-known to the
user- music, decreasing the effectiveness of the recommendations. These
approaches focus on improving the accuracy of the recommendations. That
is, try to make
accurate predictions about what a user could listen to, or buy next,
independently of how
useful to the user could be the provided recommendations.
</p>
<p class="small">
In this Thesis we stress the importance of the user{\textquoteright}s
perceived quality of the recommendations. We model the Long Tail curve
of artist popularity to predict -potentially-
interesting and unknown music, hidden in the tail of the popularity
curve. Effective recommendation systems should promote novel and
relevant material (non-obvious recommendations), taken primarily from
the tail of a popularity distribution.
</p>
<p class="small">
The main contributions of this Thesis are: <em>(i)</em> a novel network-based approach for
recommender systems, based on the analysis of the item (or user) similarity graph, and the
popularity of the items, <em>(ii)</em> a user-centric evaluation that measures the user{\textquoteright}s relevance
and novelty of the recommendations, and <em>(iii)</em> two prototype systems that implement the
ideas derived from the theoretical work. Our findings have significant implications for
recommender systems that assist users to explore the Long Tail, digging for content they
might like.
